Elastic search ->search engine ,noSql database?
Logstash-> log pipeline tool
Kibana ->Visualisation UI layer



STEP 1:
RUN ELASTIC ENGINE:
go to bin folder run elasticsearch.bat
localhost:9200
Step 2:
For running kibana ,first need to give the elasti search enable(uncomment) in 
kibana.yml in conf folder.
go to bin folder run kibana.bat
localhost:5601
we can see kibana dashboard
http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices (to find the indexes present in our kibana)
//steps to create the custom index 
go to kibana dashboard ->dev tools ->write the query to create the index
PUT /<name_of index>
{
      "settings" : {
         "index"  : {
             "number_of_shards" :3,
             "number_of_replicas" :2
         }
      }
}
//steps to create the documents in that index:
POST /micorservicedummy/default/
{
"name":"event processing",
"instructor":{
"firstName":"devika",
"lastName":"Siva"
}

}






STEP 3:
Give the path of log file in app.properties as logging.file.name= C:/Loggers/BookingService.log
Give the path of your log files in seperate conf file in logstash bin folder.
enter this in your conf file.
input { 
 	file{
	path => "C:/Loggers/BookingService.log"
	start_position => "beginning"
}

}
output {
  elasticsearch { hosts => ["localhost:9200"] }
  stdout { codec => rubydebug }
}

Run this file by giving ....\bin>logstash -f <filename>.conf
